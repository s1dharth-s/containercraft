## Containercraft

This app will let you create development environments for python as a docker container to be used with VS Code [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

The created container will already be set up for python development with many best-practices already implemented. This includes:  
    - Linting and formatting with Ruff.  
    - Type checking with mypy.  
    - Testing with pytest.
